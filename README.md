# Algorithms

Hello, if you are new to programming (as I am) I hope you find this repository helpful.

This is my study repository for algorithms written in Ruby.

## binary_search folder

binarysearch.rb - 1st binary search algorithm I wrote to practice. Binary Search only works with a sorted array of itens. To compare, if that example in the file was done with simple search it would take O(99) instead of O(6.64).

binarysearch_guessing_game.rb - Guessing game using binary search to practice a couple concepts, like max attempts/steps as binary search uses log n elements to determine how many steps maximum will it need to fetch the result you are looking for. In other words, for the example of the game, guessing between 0 and 100, log base 2 of 100 is equal to 6.64, max of 7 attempts.
